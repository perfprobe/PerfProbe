Panapticon instruments Andorid's framework and kernel to intercept OS-wide events and is currently deployed on Nexus 4 (Android 4.4.4) and Nexus 6 (Android 5.1.1). 
In the current implemenation, a userspace logging program periodically uploads event traces to a remote server. 

To parse OS event traces generated by Panappticon, run the following script:
    ./parse_event.sh $app_name
    
To build the event parsing tools, run the following commands:
    gcc -o parse parse.c
