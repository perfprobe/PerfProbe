# PerfProbe
Android app performance diagnosis tool

#### Tool description
User-perceived performance problems occur in an unpredictable and sophisticated way in mobile apps. However, we see a lack of effective approach to facilitate app developers in debugging such intermittent performance problems. To address this limitation, we develop a systematic debugging framework PerfProbe, that automatically diagnoses intermittent user-perceived performance problems in mobile apps. PerfProbe leverages app and OS-layer runtime information and applies a novel, two-step statistical analysis to associate an appâ€™s code-level execution and its underlying OS resource usage to the cause of a performance problem. To provide holistic understanding on the root cause and ac- tionable hints for debugging, it pinpoints critical functions and their underlying resource factors relevant to a problem.
